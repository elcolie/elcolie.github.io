    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Sarit Ritwirune. I currently work in the software development domain, focusing on both backend and
      frontend website development.
    <p>
      My passion project is to build a website that helps people connect with each other, such as a dating website or a
      social network. Then I can apply A.I. or Machine Learning to improve the user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a background in Physics and Computer Science from Mahidol University, where I received a working
      scholarship for both degrees. My soft skills include problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. I am a good
      listener and always open to new ideas.

      I have over 8 years of experience with Python programming and around 3 years as a data scientist. My favorite
      frameworks are Django, Vue.js, PyTorch, sklearn. Although frontend development is not my strongest skill, I am
      actively improving
      it.
